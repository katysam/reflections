What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a .git folder that it uses to track changes to files


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area are the files that will be committed in the next commit
Working directory is all the files in the directory, whether they are being tracked or not
Non-tracked files could be useful for files that will never change, or related notes
I don't really see that point for not tracking everything in the directory, at least at this point.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can select just the files connected to the change you are targeting
Other files that have changed can be committed at a different time, or not committed, as needed
